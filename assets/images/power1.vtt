2
00:00:11,462 --> 00:00:13,629
Trust me. This isn't the story

3
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:16,224
I expected to be telling,

4
00:00:16,226 --> 00:00:18,042
but you know as well as I do

5
00:00:18,044 --> 00:00:21,971
that stories, like the
people who tell them,

6
00:00:21,973 --> 00:00:24,482
aren't always what they seem.

7
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,886
Let's take a picture, Beth.

8
00:01:07,418 --> 00:01:10,611
Mom! Wake up! No! Mom!

9
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:15,033
Batman's here. He's gonna save us!

10
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:29,564
Batman, where are you going? Wait!

11
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:31,132
You're leaving us to die!

12
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:33,559
Beth, grab my hand!

13
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:35,356
Grab my hand!

14
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,857
- Kate!
- Mom, Beth, no!

15
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:56,913
- Too slow.
- You covered the damn hole!

16
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:01,756
And you found way, own way.

17
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,736
Tomorrow, find faster.

18
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:08,820
Brrr.

19
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:13,749
I suppose I should start here in Gotham.

20
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:16,794
3 years ago when Batman
mysteriously disappeared,

21
00:02:16,797 --> 00:02:18,838
it divided the city.

22
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:20,180
Some hoped he'd be back,

23
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:21,999
others figured he was dead.

24
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:24,708
I thought he abandoned
Gotham for the same reason

25
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,752
he abandoned my family...

26
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:29,065
because he didn't care.

27
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:57,576
How cute is this little kid?

28
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,799
Mary, you're embarrassing me.

29
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:09,087
Excuse me, ma'am.

30
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:12,152
Heh heh. This isn't
beneath you, Commander?

31
00:03:12,155 --> 00:03:16,479
Well, it's the only excuse I
have to see my radiant wife.

32
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:19,039
Concerned the police couldn't keep order

33
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:22,539
in a Gotham without Batman,
my dad started Crows Security,

34
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:24,434
a private firm that protects the people

35
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,415
that the Dark Knight left behind.

36
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:30,084
Moore to Crows' nest.
North side's clear.

37
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:31,515
How are we out front?

38
00:03:31,518 --> 00:03:33,060
Perimeter looks good.

39
00:03:33,063 --> 00:03:34,905
What's the word, Vasquez?

40
00:03:34,907 --> 00:03:36,887
- West Side's clear.
- Copy.

41
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,990
Let's lock it up.

42
00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:42,644
All right, Dodgson. How much?

43
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:45,892
10,000 bucks a plate just
to watch a light flip off.

44
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:47,918
- Must be nice.
- Heh.

45
00:03:52,258 --> 00:03:54,994
Operational leadership
at its best, Agent Moore.

46
00:03:54,997 --> 00:03:56,455
Well done tonight.

47
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,697
My pleasure, sir.

48
00:03:58,914 --> 00:04:02,616
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight is about reality.

49
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:05,102
Batman gave up on us.

50
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:07,196
It's been 3 years, Gotham.

51
00:04:07,198 --> 00:04:09,698
The Bat's not coming back.

52
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,146
Mayor Akins, help us say good-bye

53
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:14,110
to Gotham's outdated tradition.

54
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:17,798
It's time to turn off the signal.

55
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:25,455
My kid used to stare at this thing

56
00:04:25,457 --> 00:04:26,790
through his bedroom window.

57
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:28,500
Now I got to be the one to flip it off?

58
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:31,003
Together, I invite you to gaze out

59
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:33,257
at the Bat-Signal one last time.

60
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:38,333
Uh, Commander Kane, I just
lost our city surveillance.

61
00:04:38,336 --> 00:04:39,887
What about the rooftop feed?

62
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,775
- Sir, we're totally blind.
- Something's up.

63
00:04:42,778 --> 00:04:44,204
Eyes everywhere.

64
00:04:45,727 --> 00:04:47,755
We're gonna start the
countdown, Officer.

65
00:04:47,758 --> 00:04:49,546
Copy. Standing by.

66
00:04:49,549 --> 00:04:51,021
10...

67
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,291
Agh!

68
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:54,143
8, 7...

69
00:04:54,146 --> 00:04:55,131
Unh!

70
00:04:55,134 --> 00:04:58,770
6, 5, 4,

71
00:04:58,773 --> 00:05:02,533
3, 2, 1.

72
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:10,725
Turn the light off, boys.

73
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:13,187
What's happening?

74
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:20,301
"Hello", said Alice.

75
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:22,941
"Shall we believe the
Crows will protect us?"

76
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:25,923
Heh heh heh. Well, I
believe 6 impossible things

77
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,550
before breakfast.

78
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:30,354
Do you feel safe behind
these security gates?

79
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:33,905
Ha ha! Because one of you
won't be going home tonight.

80
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:39,270
The Crows are not the
hero of this story, Gotham.

81
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:42,700
Batman couldn't save you,

82
00:05:42,703 --> 00:05:46,547
and neither... will... they.

83
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:51,792
Get these people out of here now.

84
00:05:51,794 --> 00:05:53,618
Let's go. Let's go.

85
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:54,715
Mom?

86
00:05:54,718 --> 00:05:56,120
Jacob, what the hell are you...

87
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,085
Get out now. Let's go.

88
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:25,044
Agent Moore, do you copy?

89
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:26,203
Hyah!

90
00:06:26,206 --> 00:06:28,231
Sophie, do you copy?

91
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,043
Aah!

92
00:06:38,046 --> 00:06:39,335
Unh!

93
00:06:39,338 --> 00:06:41,080
Aah!

94
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,907
Ohh!

95
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,969
We got her.

96
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:53,015
Aah!

97
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,103
Call for you.

98
00:07:16,106 --> 00:07:18,666
Girl who talk too much.

99
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,848
- Hello?
- Kate, it's Mary.

100
00:07:29,851 --> 00:07:31,952
- Your stepsister.
- Mary, our parents

101
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:33,477
have been married for over a decade.

102
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:34,811
I know who you are.

103
00:07:34,813 --> 00:07:37,331
Oh. Okay. You have to
swear you won't tell anyone

104
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,692
- I'm telling you this...
- Mary, what happened?

105
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:44,672
Sophie's missing. They
think someone took her.

106
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:47,853
I just... I thought you should know.

107
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:49,656
Ha ha!

108
00:07:58,892 --> 00:08:01,317
I'd spent years traveling the world,

109
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,774
training with combat and
survivalist specialists

110
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:05,288
so I could join the Crows.

111
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,742
Sophie's disappearance
brought me home early.

112
00:08:07,745 --> 00:08:09,976
I had to find her, but first,

113
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:12,533
I had to convince my dad I was ready.

114
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:15,611
Crows represent order, security, safety.

115
00:08:15,613 --> 00:08:18,706
These monsters long
for the good, old days

116
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,390
when gangs ran around unchecked.

117
00:08:20,393 --> 00:08:23,377
They spread fear by saying, "look at us.

118
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,502
We can get a Crow,
we can get your wife,

119
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,222
your kid."

120
00:08:27,225 --> 00:08:28,790
Where are we on surveillance?

121
00:08:28,793 --> 00:08:30,492
Afraid it doesn't exist, sir.

122
00:08:30,494 --> 00:08:31,993
If it were any one of you,

123
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:33,980
Agent Moore would not sleep

124
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:36,150
until you were found.

125
00:08:36,153 --> 00:08:38,269
Let's do the same for her.

126
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:40,457
Let's bring her home.

127
00:08:50,134 --> 00:08:51,634
Kate.

128
00:08:51,637 --> 00:08:53,196
Hey, Dad.

129
00:08:56,627 --> 00:08:58,752
Come here, kiddo.

130
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,547
I, uh... I didn't have cream,

131
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,971
but please tell me you
kicked that vegan thing, huh?

132
00:09:11,974 --> 00:09:13,577
I wish you'd called.

133
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:15,891
- We're gonna find her.
- Then let me help.

134
00:09:15,894 --> 00:09:17,236
Neck tattoo. That's new.

135
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:19,915
Dad, I'm ready to come
home and work for you.

136
00:09:19,918 --> 00:09:21,560
Sir, Mayor's on two.

137
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:24,374
He's talking about canceling
the movie in the park.

138
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:26,603
Tell him I'll be right there.

139
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:31,005
Do you know who took her?

140
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:32,629
Ruthless, spineless maniacs

141
00:09:32,632 --> 00:09:34,523
who frankly don't stand
a chance against a team

142
00:09:34,525 --> 00:09:36,725
of ex-Navy SEALs and Green Berets.

143
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:39,856
- And what about me?
- You take after your cousin.

144
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:41,605
You're a female Bruce Wayne,

145
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:43,624
but unlike him, you actually have a shot

146
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:45,379
at making something of your life.

147
00:09:45,382 --> 00:09:47,975
Bruce was the one person
who was actually there for me

148
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:49,310
after Mom and Beth died.

149
00:09:49,313 --> 00:09:52,967
Let me help the Crows find Sophie.

150
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:57,179
It's great to see you, but
I got to take this call.

151
00:10:00,731 --> 00:10:02,514
Ha ha!

152
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,366
How about we don't get expelled

153
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:11,153
a week before graduation?

154
00:10:11,156 --> 00:10:12,828
About that.

155
00:10:12,831 --> 00:10:14,948
How about after we graduate

156
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:16,575
I take you to the Greek isles

157
00:10:16,578 --> 00:10:18,701
for a week alone on a yacht?

158
00:10:18,704 --> 00:10:19,790
All alone...

159
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:23,722
But, like, with a chef?

160
00:10:23,725 --> 00:10:26,329
- Obviously.
- Heh.

161
00:10:28,473 --> 00:10:33,026
Oh, Shed, things you have seen.

162
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:36,289
Defacing school property.

163
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:38,007
Heh. Why not?

164
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,374
Got me to break every other rule.

165
00:10:44,962 --> 00:10:48,046
"Loves." Bold.

166
00:10:57,563 --> 00:10:59,057
Cadet Katherine Kane,

167
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,827
is there something you'd like to report

168
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,841
to your squad?

169
00:11:01,844 --> 00:11:03,110
Not that I'm aware of, sir!

170
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:05,063
Perhaps, you're not
aware of the Academy's

171
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:07,024
code of conduct.

172
00:11:07,027 --> 00:11:08,833
I had to find her,

173
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,608
so I needed to go to the one place

174
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:12,870
that always seemed to have the answers,

175
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,498
to the heart of Gotham,

176
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:18,033
which just happened to
have eyes all over the city.

177
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,865
Bruce isn't in his office. Come on.

178
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:58,908
Kate, we're not supposed to be in here.

179
00:12:08,108 --> 00:12:12,435
What's that? Why does Bruce
have a girl's necklace?

180
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:14,697
Come on.

181
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:19,179
No. I don't think
we're supposed to touch that.

182
00:12:19,182 --> 00:12:21,516
Come on.

183
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,937
Step away from the desk! Move!

184
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:31,630
Wayne Security.

185
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:35,394
Not to tell you how
to do your job, Mr...

186
00:12:35,397 --> 00:12:37,063
- Luke.
- Luke,

187
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:39,083
but your boss is my cousin.

188
00:12:39,086 --> 00:12:41,395
Think you're the first
squatter I've met related

189
00:12:41,398 --> 00:12:42,496
to Bruce Wayne?

190
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:44,098
How the hell did you even get in here?

191
00:12:44,101 --> 00:12:46,380
I'm Kate Kane. I
practically grew up here,

192
00:12:46,383 --> 00:12:49,988
and Bruce was like my fun,
irresponsible big brother.

193
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:52,603
Okay. When's his birthday?

194
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,983
- February 19.
- Middle name?

195
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:57,441
Trick question. Doesn't have one.

196
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:58,777
Favorite soup?

197
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,988
Is it weird that you know that?

198
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,033
If you are Bruce's cousin,

199
00:13:04,035 --> 00:13:05,935
you know that no one's heard from him

200
00:13:05,938 --> 00:13:07,578
in almost 3 years.

201
00:13:16,246 --> 00:13:18,338
Hey. Yeah. Luke Fox over at Wayne here.

202
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,632
Got another B&E for you.

203
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:25,995
Bruce gave me a great
piece of advice once.

204
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:27,872
Grow into the person
you needed as a kid.

205
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,516
That's great. Police are on their way.

206
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:32,796
Oh. It... it turns out that the
person that I needed as a kid

207
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,400
can do this.

208
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:42,909
Hey! Get these handcuffs
off me right now.

209
00:13:42,912 --> 00:13:45,129
Password still "Alfred"?

210
00:13:45,132 --> 00:13:47,328
- Hey!
- You might want to change that.

211
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:49,790
Wait. You can't...

212
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:52,493
can you just step away
from the computer, please?

213
00:13:52,496 --> 00:13:54,342
Agh.

214
00:13:54,345 --> 00:13:56,334
Hey. What are you doing?

215
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:58,115
What the Crows aren't able to.

216
00:13:58,118 --> 00:13:59,877
Get this thing off me.

217
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,993
Hey, hey. You can't just...

218
00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:11,808
See the relation now.

219
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:25,964
Dad, I think I found something.

220
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:27,789
Surprise!

221
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:29,000
Aah!

222
00:14:29,003 --> 00:14:31,045
Keep us waiting, why don't you?

223
00:14:31,048 --> 00:14:32,213
- Hi.
- Hi!

224
00:14:32,216 --> 00:14:33,359
- Mary.
- Hi.

225
00:14:33,362 --> 00:14:35,062
Where's, uh... where's my dad?

226
00:14:35,065 --> 00:14:40,319
No idea because you, me,
cotton candy shots now. Good?

227
00:14:40,322 --> 00:14:42,405
So I'm on the roof, Alice
is threatening to kill

228
00:14:42,407 --> 00:14:43,999
literally everybody,
and the first thought

229
00:14:44,001 --> 00:14:46,301
that pops into my brain is
"Oh, my God. What a bummer.

230
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:49,245
Now I'll never be able to read
my future children 'Alice in Wonderland'",

231
00:14:49,247 --> 00:14:50,955
but then I was like, "Oh, Mary,

232
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:52,966
rearranging your entire life out of fear

233
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:54,676
is exactly how the terrorists win."

234
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:56,121
Why did you call me?

235
00:14:56,124 --> 00:14:58,130
I may have found a box
of pictures in your closet

236
00:14:58,133 --> 00:14:59,539
when I was borrowing
your Balenciaga T...

237
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,644
- You know what? Never mind.
- Look. I don't know your drama,

238
00:15:01,646 --> 00:15:03,730
but we all got a box
of picture somewhere.

239
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:06,584
I just thought you'd want to be here.

240
00:15:06,587 --> 00:15:08,681
Welcome home, Katie.

241
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:10,192
I hope you don't mind my making you

242
00:15:10,194 --> 00:15:12,444
the center of attention tonight.

243
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:13,944
No place I'd rather be.

244
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:16,197
Then let's make sure
we're posting happy photos

245
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,714
to our social media accounts.

246
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,861
Because why wouldn't
this party have an agenda?

247
00:15:19,864 --> 00:15:20,888
If we feel safe,

248
00:15:20,891 --> 00:15:22,609
then our clients feel safe.

249
00:15:22,612 --> 00:15:24,053
Movie in the park is Friday,

250
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,708
and it's Gotham's first
public event in 3 years.

251
00:15:26,711 --> 00:15:30,762
Anyway, the councilwoman
would like a photo, Mary.

252
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:33,033
Excuse us.

253
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:43,752
"I hereby deny the below allegation

254
00:15:43,755 --> 00:15:45,754
of homosexual conduct."

255
00:15:45,757 --> 00:15:49,443
Blah, blah, blah. Kiss my ass.

256
00:15:50,602 --> 00:15:51,934
Guess that's that then.

257
00:15:51,937 --> 00:15:53,827
What do you say we burn these

258
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:56,163
and scatter the ashes
across the Mediterranean?

259
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:05,079
I can't. I'm staying.

260
00:16:08,893 --> 00:16:11,369
You signed it.

261
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:14,610
I told them what they wanted to hear.

262
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:15,881
You lied.

263
00:16:15,884 --> 00:16:18,501
I need this school,
okay? I want to be here.

264
00:16:18,503 --> 00:16:20,095
But they don't want you.

265
00:16:20,097 --> 00:16:24,841
Unfortunately, I don't have the
luxury of being offended by that.

266
00:16:28,743 --> 00:16:30,910
And maybe it's best if
you just kept your distance

267
00:16:30,913 --> 00:16:33,748
from now on.

268
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:35,518
Hey.

269
00:16:38,303 --> 00:16:41,104
I know you love me.

270
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:44,193
Tell me that I'm wrong,
and I'll walk away

271
00:16:44,195 --> 00:16:46,213
and let you make the
biggest mistake of your life.

272
00:16:48,823 --> 00:16:50,507
You're wrong, Kate.

273
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,797
I have to go.

274
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:10,515
Dad, I have something.

275
00:17:10,518 --> 00:17:12,147
Where'd you get this?

276
00:17:12,149 --> 00:17:15,095
Wayne's camera feed isn't
on the Crows' network.

277
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:16,452
Wayne's defunct.

278
00:17:16,455 --> 00:17:19,373
Not sure how facial rec's
supposed to work here.

279
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:21,476
They're in masks.

280
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:27,546
Wait. What does that paddle say?

281
00:17:29,812 --> 00:17:33,759
"Milk", "well-behaved", "C-H".

282
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:36,871
"Not for the mild, well-behaved child."

283
00:17:36,873 --> 00:17:39,290
It was their creepy
disciplinary motto.

284
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,604
- It was whose model?
- The Burnside Orphanage.

285
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:44,052
Beth and I used to sneak in
there with our ouija board

286
00:17:44,055 --> 00:17:45,387
and freak each other out.

287
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,585
That's where they are.

288
00:17:46,588 --> 00:17:47,772
Taylor, get a satellite feed.

289
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,287
I want eyes all over this.

290
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,092
Dodgson, cover the
north entrance with me.

291
00:17:51,095 --> 00:17:53,688
Banks takes his team on the south.

292
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:57,152
Kate.

293
00:18:31,206 --> 00:18:32,890
Aah!

294
00:18:54,677 --> 00:18:56,319
Unh!

295
00:19:22,657 --> 00:19:24,508
Aah!

296
00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:49,321
Curiouser and curiouser.

297
00:19:49,324 --> 00:19:51,950
Up, up.

298
00:19:55,303 --> 00:19:57,211
I thought you'd been sent away,

299
00:19:57,214 --> 00:20:00,618
but now you seem to be... here.

300
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:16,860
How do you know me?

301
00:20:16,863 --> 00:20:18,672
Better now.

302
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,916
Where's Sophie?

303
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,211
Gone, and just in time

304
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:29,525
because I am not used to being found.

305
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,052
Clever girl.

306
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:33,031
If you didn't want an audience,

307
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:35,275
I'd be dead.

308
00:20:35,278 --> 00:20:37,061
So what do you want?

309
00:20:37,064 --> 00:20:40,233
I need you to send
your father a message.

310
00:20:40,236 --> 00:20:43,323
He thinks he's Gotham's white knight,

311
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,459
but he's a bully whose army bullies

312
00:20:45,462 --> 00:20:46,953
this city into obedience,

313
00:20:46,956 --> 00:20:49,114
and I want the world to know

314
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:51,902
that he doesn't scare me.

315
00:20:51,905 --> 00:20:53,229
Heh.

316
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:57,060
I want to take away his power.

317
00:20:57,063 --> 00:21:00,873
Then take me and let Sophie go.

318
00:21:00,876 --> 00:21:06,513
Oh, dear. This is... Quite sad actually.

319
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,400
You poor thing.

320
00:21:10,128 --> 00:21:11,978
You haven't figured it out yet.

321
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,465
I took Sophie because she'll
actually get his attention.

322
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:19,594
Your father doesn't want you, Kate.

323
00:21:19,596 --> 00:21:22,289
He shipped you away, and you show up

324
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:24,518
without the proper postage.

325
00:21:26,311 --> 00:21:28,862
I assumed you knew,

326
00:21:28,865 --> 00:21:32,331
but then again, you have been so busy

327
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,642
trying to convince him to love you,

328
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:38,956
you sweet, pathetic girl.

329
00:21:40,658 --> 00:21:45,980
Sophie is the daughter
your father always wanted,

330
00:21:45,983 --> 00:21:50,435
not you... dear.

331
00:21:50,438 --> 00:21:52,924
Who the hell are you?

332
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:54,477
Right.

333
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,740
I'm Alice. How do you do?

334
00:22:06,001 --> 00:22:08,018
Dodgson, what do you got?

335
00:22:08,021 --> 00:22:10,143
- Just missed them, sir.
- Where's Kate?

336
00:22:10,146 --> 00:22:12,253
Found her bike stashed in some bushes

337
00:22:12,256 --> 00:22:13,273
but no sign of her.

338
00:22:13,276 --> 00:22:15,145
What do you mean no sign of her?

339
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:22,320
Where am I?

340
00:22:22,323 --> 00:22:26,092
Hi, and don't kill me.

341
00:22:32,283 --> 00:22:33,635
What is this place?

342
00:22:33,637 --> 00:22:38,214
This is my humble,
little... Illegal clinic.

343
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:40,458
Gotham University has generously

344
00:22:40,461 --> 00:22:43,203
and unknowingly leant me...

345
00:22:43,206 --> 00:22:45,053
Hey, Mr. Whittaker.

346
00:22:45,056 --> 00:22:47,598
We're gonna have to keep that on, okay?

347
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,238
We talked about this, remember?

348
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:50,799
Got to keep that on.

349
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,378
Can we be done with
this? I got to... unh.

350
00:22:53,381 --> 00:22:56,057
Ooh. Ow. Hang on.

351
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,034
I was mid-stitch.

352
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:00,828
How did you find me?

353
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,238
Someone dumped you at the door.

354
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,888
One of my guys brought you in.

355
00:23:03,891 --> 00:23:06,392
You have guys?

356
00:23:06,395 --> 00:23:09,875
So I swear this began with me offering

357
00:23:09,878 --> 00:23:12,045
water and band-aids, and
the next thing you know,

358
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:13,981
I'm the Meredith Grey
of Sherwood Forest.

359
00:23:13,984 --> 00:23:17,920
I'm sorry if stealing from my
med school makes me a bad person.

360
00:23:17,922 --> 00:23:21,423
It doesn't. It actually makes you

361
00:23:21,426 --> 00:23:22,931
deeper than I thought.

362
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:25,452
Oh. Thanks.

363
00:23:27,098 --> 00:23:29,658
- Done.
- Keep your ear to the street,

364
00:23:29,661 --> 00:23:31,943
and if you hear anything
about Sophie, call.

365
00:23:31,946 --> 00:23:33,695
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

366
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:38,636
I was right. Alice was there,

367
00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:41,444
and wherever they went,
it's probably not far.

368
00:23:41,446 --> 00:23:43,129
Where the hell have you been?

369
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,447
We thought she took you, too.

370
00:23:44,449 --> 00:23:46,323
I got half my guys out
there looking for you!

371
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:48,297
And here I am telling you her vendetta

372
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,494
isn't against Gotham,
isn't against the Crows,

373
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:51,979
but against you.

374
00:23:51,982 --> 00:23:53,963
- Why?
- You are not listening.

375
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,522
You ran into an unknown terrorist cell

376
00:23:55,525 --> 00:23:56,600
without proper backup.

377
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:57,947
If you treated me like everybody else,

378
00:23:57,949 --> 00:24:02,140
- I would have had backup.
- Except you're not everyone else.

379
00:24:02,143 --> 00:24:05,495
No, I'm not.

380
00:24:05,498 --> 00:24:07,677
I never will be

381
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,143
because no matter what I do
trying to prove myself to you,

382
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:14,238
you don't want me.

383
00:24:15,743 --> 00:24:19,829
What did I tell you after you
got expelled from the Academy?

384
00:24:19,832 --> 00:24:23,027
Kate, I love you. I wouldn't
want you any other way.

385
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:24,204
I remember what you said because

386
00:24:24,206 --> 00:24:26,791
it was right before you sent
me away to train for a job

387
00:24:26,794 --> 00:24:27,867
that you were never gonna give me.

388
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:29,692
I was giving you a second chance!

389
00:24:29,695 --> 00:24:32,428
You were getting rid of me!

390
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:35,918
Because when you look
at me, you see Beth,

391
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:38,667
and when you see Beth, you see Mom,

392
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:40,138
and instead of dealing with it,

393
00:24:40,141 --> 00:24:43,222
you spent the last 15
years pushing me away!

394
00:24:45,435 --> 00:24:49,414
You win, Dad. I'm gone.

395
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:53,642
Kate.

396
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,375
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey! How
did you even get in... agh.

397
00:25:00,378 --> 00:25:01,732
I know you know where Bruce is.

398
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,608
Call him and tell him that
I am looking for someone.

399
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,979
- I have no idea where he is.
- That was me asking nicely.

400
00:25:05,982 --> 00:25:07,654
Okay. If Bruce wanted to come home...

401
00:25:07,657 --> 00:25:09,958
He would. He would for me.

402
00:25:09,961 --> 00:25:12,211
Okay. Ugh.

403
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:18,937
Someone moved that.

404
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,920
How the hell would you know?

405
00:25:23,548 --> 00:25:24,731
It was my Aunt Martha's.

406
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:26,316
She was wearing it the night that she

407
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:28,884
and my Uncle Thomas were killed,

408
00:25:28,886 --> 00:25:33,531
but he always kept it... here.

409
00:25:44,595 --> 00:25:46,814
Look. You... you don't want to do that.

410
00:25:46,817 --> 00:25:48,349
I mean, it looks really old.

411
00:25:48,352 --> 00:25:50,278
Probably not even up to code, you know,

412
00:25:50,281 --> 00:25:52,373
if it even works.

413
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,582
You are seriously not supposed
to know what's down there.

414
00:25:59,584 --> 00:26:01,551
So I have this thing with rules.

415
00:27:22,072 --> 00:27:24,531
Bruce Wayne is Batman?

416
00:27:26,808 --> 00:27:29,335
Yeah. I'm dead.

417
00:27:34,824 --> 00:27:37,797
The Bruce I knew had a million secrets,

418
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,451
and now I know why
they were kept from me.

419
00:27:54,949 --> 00:27:56,281
Let's take a picture, Beth.

420
00:27:56,283 --> 00:27:58,306
Make sure our necklaces are in it.

421
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:01,110
There. Ready? Cheese!

422
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:05,001
What is this guy doing?

423
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:10,166
Beth, are you okay?

424
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:11,459
We're gonna go over!

425
00:28:11,462 --> 00:28:13,756
Batman's here. He's gonna save us!

426
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:18,071
He spent years trying to figure out

427
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:19,813
what went wrong that day.

428
00:28:19,816 --> 00:28:21,650
He knew the car was gonna go over,

429
00:28:21,653 --> 00:28:23,361
so he shot two hooks,

430
00:28:23,364 --> 00:28:26,532
each with a safe load of one ton.

431
00:28:26,535 --> 00:28:28,813
The weight, the angle...

432
00:28:28,816 --> 00:28:31,150
he was so sure he secured the car.

433
00:28:31,152 --> 00:28:34,253
Go, Kate! Hurry! Get out!

434
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:36,947
Where are you going, Batman? Wait!

435
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:40,125
Wake up now! Mom, please!

436
00:28:40,128 --> 00:28:44,167
Beth, you need to grab my hand now!

437
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,486
Kate!

438
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:48,699
Grab my hand!

439
00:28:48,702 --> 00:28:50,460
No!

440
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:54,465
Beth! No!

441
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:59,383
Mom! Beth!

442
00:28:59,386 --> 00:29:02,227
The steel in the trunk
still ripped away.

443
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,766
It was crappy engineering.

444
00:29:03,768 --> 00:29:06,193
It was the one
calculation he didn't make.

445
00:29:06,195 --> 00:29:08,723
I grew up thinking
that Batman cared more

446
00:29:08,726 --> 00:29:11,032
about getting the bad guy than...

447
00:29:11,034 --> 00:29:13,135
The lives of innocent people.

448
00:29:13,138 --> 00:29:15,588
No. He cared.

449
00:29:15,591 --> 00:29:17,797
He saved 34 kids that day.

450
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:20,476
He thought he saved
your mom and sister, too.

451
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:27,904
I mean, his only living family,

452
00:29:27,907 --> 00:29:29,200
and he got it wrong.

453
00:29:29,203 --> 00:29:31,503
Haunted the hell out of him.

454
00:29:36,057 --> 00:29:37,933
Yeah. Don't push that.

455
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:48,750
Whoa.

456
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:51,071
Nope. Okay. Heh.

457
00:29:51,074 --> 00:29:54,623
Not about to get my ass
fired twice by Batman, so...

458
00:30:01,939 --> 00:30:04,582
Find your own way.

459
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:08,346
- What?
- That's why Bruce became Batman,

460
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:10,165
to play by his own rules.

461
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:12,835
It made him terrifying to his enemies.

462
00:30:12,837 --> 00:30:14,812
Yeah, and his friends and his co-workers.

463
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:15,987
We really need to go.

464
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,332
People aren't afraid anymore.

465
00:30:18,335 --> 00:30:22,170
An army may not scare them,

466
00:30:22,173 --> 00:30:24,006
but that will.

467
00:30:25,182 --> 00:30:27,942
I need you to fix his suit.

468
00:30:27,944 --> 00:30:30,978
The suit is literal perfection.

469
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,975
It will be... When it fits a woman.

470
00:30:39,122 --> 00:30:41,480
- Mary.
- We found one of Alice's guys.

471
00:30:41,483 --> 00:30:43,516
I think I know where they took Sophie.

Who's covering it?

483
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:24,959
That'd be Dodgson, sir.

484
00:31:29,176 --> 00:31:30,940
Dodgson.

485
00:31:34,308 --> 00:31:35,937
I love it.

486
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,292
Have fun.

487
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:46,194
You, too.

488
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:48,521
Traitor! Don't!

489
00:31:48,524 --> 00:31:50,291
Don't!

490
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:02,181
Commander,

491
00:32:02,184 --> 00:32:04,946
dare I say Gotham is looking a little

492
00:32:04,949 --> 00:32:06,281
like the good, old days.

493
00:32:06,283 --> 00:32:07,499
Sorry I had my doubts.

494
00:32:07,501 --> 00:32:09,826
City trusts us for a reason, Mayor.

495
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:11,944
Enjoy the movie. Excuse me.

496
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:13,121
Kane.

497
00:32:13,124 --> 00:32:15,633
I haven't missed the show, have I?

498
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,220
Now you tell me where you are,

499
00:32:19,222 --> 00:32:21,922
and then I'll dump you at Arkham myself.

500
00:32:21,924 --> 00:32:23,892
We're all mad here, Commander.

501
00:32:23,895 --> 00:32:25,225
I'm mad, you're mad.

502
00:32:25,228 --> 00:32:28,795
Sanity is so... pedestrian.

503
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:30,660
I want to be memorable,

504
00:32:30,663 --> 00:32:33,326
the kind of girl who
never leaves your thoughts,

505
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:34,994
so I took it upon myself

506
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:38,304
to fill a Crows' truck
with forget-me-nots.

507
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:57,836
"How do you like the
Queen?" said the cat.

508
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:00,873
These are families, kids.

509
00:33:00,876 --> 00:33:03,131
Keep your mouth shut, and everyone

510
00:33:03,134 --> 00:33:06,216
will stay alive to see
how this boring movie ends.

511
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:08,878
Try anything, and pfeewww!

512
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:10,970
Look up.

513
00:33:10,973 --> 00:33:14,515
You'd never forget about
Sophie, would you, Commander,

514
00:33:14,518 --> 00:33:17,411
your favorite little
birdie up in the sky,

515
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:18,602
but, oh, dear, oh, my,

516
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:20,480
can your little birdie fly,

517
00:33:20,483 --> 00:33:22,757
for if she moves an inch,

518
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,351
she'll die.

519
00:33:24,354 --> 00:33:25,720
Pick one, Commander...

520
00:33:25,723 --> 00:33:28,651
Sophie or Gotham.

521
00:33:30,283 --> 00:33:31,907
Why are you doing this?

522
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,837
Why is a raven like a writing desk?

523
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:37,934
Aah!

524
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,200
Who's there?

525
00:33:44,264 --> 00:33:46,115
Aah!

526
00:33:52,025 --> 00:33:53,939
I thought you were dead.

527
00:34:01,157 --> 00:34:02,230
Simple math.

528
00:34:02,232 --> 00:34:03,749
Barrel weighs 500 pounds.

529
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:06,568
Birdie weighs a quarter of that.

530
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,783
Once barrel weighs less than birdie...

531
00:34:09,786 --> 00:34:11,762
Whoa! Ohh!

532
00:34:37,848 --> 00:34:38,865
Unh!

533
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,817
Aah!

534
00:34:44,486 --> 00:34:46,286
No!

535
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:49,843
Raah!

536
00:34:52,386 --> 00:34:54,395
Aah!

537
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:08,804
You're...

538
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:10,867
Not him.

539
00:35:53,004 --> 00:35:55,680
Mommy, look!

540
00:35:55,683 --> 00:35:57,734
It's Batman!

541
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:06,747
Good morning, Gotham.

542
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,700
Your girl Vesper Fairchild here.

543
00:36:08,703 --> 00:36:10,828
So was I dreaming,

544
00:36:10,831 --> 00:36:12,785
or is Batman really back?

545
00:36:12,788 --> 00:36:15,214
If so, things are
looking up for this city.

546
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:18,990
If not, I just revealed way
too much about my dreams.

547
00:36:18,993 --> 00:36:21,316
Talk to me, Gotham. Are you as excited

548
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:25,053
about Mr. Tall Dark
and Unavailable as I am?

549
00:36:25,056 --> 00:36:26,301
It was so cool,

550
00:36:26,304 --> 00:36:28,821
and then Batman flew into the sky

551
00:36:28,824 --> 00:36:31,274
and was swinging from buildings.

552
00:36:31,277 --> 00:36:33,714
See? I told you he'd be back.

553
00:36:33,717 --> 00:36:37,122
Dodgson and Alice are
Crows' priority number one.

554
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:38,374
What about the Bat, sir?

555
00:36:38,377 --> 00:36:41,388
Oh, come on. Seen these wannabes before.

556
00:36:41,391 --> 00:36:42,933
He gets the city all hot and bothered,

557
00:36:42,935 --> 00:36:44,738
and then thanks to a
total lack of skill,

558
00:36:44,741 --> 00:36:48,292
he usually dies in some
spectacular fashion.

559
00:36:48,295 --> 00:36:49,578
He?

560
00:36:49,581 --> 00:36:51,899
Welcome back, Agent Moore.

561
00:36:51,902 --> 00:36:53,320
You say something?

562
00:36:53,323 --> 00:36:54,766
Not important, sir.

563
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:57,330
All right. Let's find these two.

564
00:37:14,092 --> 00:37:16,968
Wouldn't drink that if I were you.

565
00:37:16,971 --> 00:37:21,867
It's toxic. Christmas
gift from Gotham police.

566
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,144
Good to know.

567
00:37:24,147 --> 00:37:25,849
Hi, by the way.

568
00:37:25,852 --> 00:37:28,913
Hi. I heard you came back for me.

569
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:30,288
Thanks.

570
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:31,957
There she is. I thought we talked

571
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,317
about never letting you
out of my sight again.

572
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:38,298
I'm fine. Seriously, I'm good.

573
00:37:38,301 --> 00:37:40,114
Tyler, this is Kate.

574
00:37:40,117 --> 00:37:43,168
Kate, Tyler works for
Crows International.

575
00:37:43,171 --> 00:37:44,536
Sorry to barge in,

576
00:37:44,538 --> 00:37:45,955
but, uh, got in late last night,

577
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:50,096
and now I am that annoyingly
overprotective husband.

578
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:52,200
You're married.

579
00:37:54,793 --> 00:37:57,177
Yeah.

580
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,514
Congratulations.

581
00:37:59,517 --> 00:38:03,093
Nice to meet you, Tyler.

582
00:38:03,096 --> 00:38:06,606
I should probably go.

583
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:08,743
See you, Sophie.

584
00:38:26,673 --> 00:38:29,031
Figured you'd left town.

585
00:38:34,504 --> 00:38:36,588
I want you to tell me that I was right.

586
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,158
You were never going to make me a Crow.

587
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,177
You're right.

588
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,989
I never wanted you to be a Crow.

589
00:38:51,947 --> 00:38:54,814
The Military was my dream for you.

590
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:57,751
I'd call in a favor, get you a desk job,

591
00:38:57,754 --> 00:38:59,665
a staff, and the occasional papercut

592
00:38:59,668 --> 00:39:02,101
would be the only
bloodshed you'd ever see.

593
00:39:02,104 --> 00:39:03,790
That wasn't my dream.

594
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:09,037
No. No. You wanted to be in the action.

595
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:11,657
That's why I didn't
want you to be a Crow...

596
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,016
because I'm selfish

597
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:17,187
and overly protective,

598
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,857
and I'm terrified

599
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:24,196
and because you're
all I have left, Kate,

600
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:27,072
and I don't want to lose you, too.

601
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:32,769
Look. This is all my way of saying

602
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:37,042
that if... if you want
to be part of the team,

603
00:39:37,045 --> 00:39:39,093
you're in.

604
00:39:47,744 --> 00:39:50,603
My dad was running from his pain,

605
00:39:50,606 --> 00:39:52,579
but I was running, too,

606
00:39:52,582 --> 00:39:54,822
toward everything that didn't want me,

607
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,612
a military academy,

608
00:39:56,615 --> 00:39:58,049
a private army,

609
00:39:58,052 --> 00:40:00,438
my own father.

610
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:04,935
I spent 15 years searching
for a place I fit,

611
00:40:04,937 --> 00:40:07,521
and I think I've finally found it.

612
00:40:07,523 --> 00:40:10,449
Some see fear, others hope.

613
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:13,143
I see the freedom to be myself,

614
00:40:13,145 --> 00:40:15,862
to play by own rules.

615
00:40:15,864 --> 00:40:19,158
I believe you're going to
come home one day, Bruce,

616
00:40:19,161 --> 00:40:21,063
and before you kill me for borrowing

617
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:22,651
a few of your things,

618
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:24,797
I want you to read my story

619
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:27,286
because it's only just begun.

620
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:29,971
Miss you, your cousin Kate.

621
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:35,962
You know, for a minute there,

622
00:40:35,965 --> 00:40:38,474
really felt like he was home.

623
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:45,341
Hey. Look. For what it's worth,

624
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:47,653
Bruce never stopped looking

625
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:49,667
for your sister's body.

626
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:52,151
It is worth more than you think.

627
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:58,167
Guy had the best tech on the planet.

628
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,471
Why didn't he find her?

629
00:41:25,062 --> 00:41:27,121
Make sure our necklaces are in it.

630
00:41:33,429 --> 00:41:35,034
Beth.

631
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:43,542
I'll win you over, my dear sister.

632
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:49,459
The two of us will rule Gotham together.

633
